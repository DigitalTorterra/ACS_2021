%% RocketModel

% November 2020
% Created by Nick Crnkovich

% Model using formulas and documentation from OpenRocket to generate our
% own simulation of the rocket apogee and position, velocity, acceleration
% data to be used for controller and ACS design


% Initialize rocket conditions

w = 10; % windspeed (pick units)
alpha = 5; % [deg] angl




% Numerical integration using RK 4
